She keeps a running blog with her music and life (including her experience at The Iron Yard) which you can
check out at www.ern-brn.com. Erin’s also talented at making up words and she’s competed in two of Durham's
Great Pun Championships. Each time she finished in the elite 8 out of 24 contestants. She experienced “dissa-pun- tment”
in not getting further in the competition this year. However, she is ready to “pun-t” the competition next year and will
challenge anyone to a friendly pun competition. Erin loves to program and is looking forward to a creative career as a
back-end engineer.")

turned his passion into a book, FitSkiing. He purchased his first Mac in 1990 and began to understand the power of software as a freshman
in high school. He learned Pagemaker and helped convert the school newspaper from cut and paste to desktop publishing. Over the last four
 years he’s helped build two software start-ups and has been lucky enough to work with some very talented developers. Andrew was recently
a featured speaker at the Internet Summit and a presenter at the Southeast Venture Conference. He prefers a fast-paced environment and has
a passion for improving health outcomes with technology.")
